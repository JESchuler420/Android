Later on default QEMU proviided by the distribution may be just as good as the one bundled with cuttlefish, but I\u0027d rather err on the side of caution and keep close to the cuttlefish QEMU for at least few years from now - it\u0027s too costly to debug riscv64 issues caused by old QEMU versions.\n\nI added a comment explaining this.",
